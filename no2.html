							<h2>Nitrogen dioxide NO₂</h2>
							<h3>General informations and impacts</h3>
						</header>

						<!-- <span class="image featured"><img src="images/banner.jpg" alt="" /></span> -->
						<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) is a major air pollutant and one of the most harmful components of
							nitrogen oxides (NOₓ), produced mainly by the combustion of fossil fuels. It is emitted by
							cars, trucks, buses, power plants and various industrial sources.
							In the atmosphere, NO₂ plays a central role in air pollution through several harmful
							processes. It contributes significantly to the formation of ground-level ozone and fine
							particulate matter, both of which can penetrate deep into the lungs and aggravate
							respiratory diseases such as asthma.
						</p>
						<p>
							Environmentally, NO₂ reacts with other atmospheric compounds to create acid rain, which
							damages forests, soils, and aquatic ecosystems. It also leads to the formation of nitrate
							particles that contribute to atmospheric haze, reducing visibility—especially in natural
							areas like national parks.
							NO₂ is also a key precursor of photochemical smog, a reddish-brown haze observed in many
							cities, especially under sunny and stagnant weather conditions. This smog results from
							complex reactions involving NOₓ, hydrocarbons, and sunlight, producing ozone and other
							irritants harmful to both humans and the environment.

						<h3>Situation in Kosovo</h3>
						<div class="row gtr-200">
							<div class="col-6 col-12-narrower">
								<p>In Kosovo, nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) is recognized as a key air pollutant, monitored
									alongside particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, ozone, and carbon monoxide at a
									network of 12 stations managed by the Kosovo Hydrometeorological Institute and the
									Kosovo Environmental Protection Agency. NO₂ concentrations are measured hourly and
									contribute directly to the national Air Quality Index.
									The main emission sources include road traffic, coal-fired power plants (Kosovo A
									and Kosovo B), residential heating, and industrial activities.
								</p>
								<p>In urban areas, especially in Pristina, NO₂ levels are particularly high due to
									heavy traffic and the use of low-quality fuels: about 52% of NO₂ pollution
									originates from transport, 28% from energy
									production, and 11% from industry.
									Monitoring data (e.g., in the ex Rilindja area) have recorded hourly peaks in NO₂
									levels of 100–132 µg/m³, significantly above WHO and EU guidelines, especially
									during winter. Although annual averages (around 20–21 µg/m³) sometimes stay below
									material
									protection limits (40 µg/m³), short term winter spikes often exceed health
									thresholds by several times. These elevated levels drive wintertime smog, acidifying
									aerosols (including nitrate particles), and heightened respiratory risks,
									particularly in urban zones with dense traffic and coal combustion.

						<p>In order to provide a clearer understanding of the spatial distribution of nitrogen dioxide
							(NO₂) pollution across Kosovo, concentration maps have been produced to represent the
							average annual levels of this pollutant throughout the country. These maps, based on data
							from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS), reclassify NO₂ concentrations into
							five distinct categories, in accordance with the reference thresholds established by the
							European Union. According to current EU air quality standards, the recommended annual limit
							for NO₂ is 40 µg/m³. This classification system allows for the
							identification of areas with elevated pollution levels, clearly highlighting zones where air
							quality falls below health protection standards. These maps serve as an essential tool for
							assessing population exposure and guiding evidence-based environmental and public health
							policies.
