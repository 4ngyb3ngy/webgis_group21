						<h3>Kosovo - Concentration Pollutant Maps</h3>

							<div class="col-6 col-12-narrower">
								<p>Concentration maps are visual representations that display the spatial distribution of air pollutants, such as NO₂ and PM₂.₅, helping to identify areas of concern and monitor compliance with environmental standards.
									These maps are typically classified into five levels based on pollutant concentration thresholds defined by the European Union.
									The table shows the EU classification system for ambient concentrations of NO₂ and PM₂.₅, divided into five levels. Each class corresponds to a specific concentration range measured in micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m³).
									The annual limit values are set at 40 µg/m³ for NO₂ and 25 µg/m³ for PM₂.₅.
									
								</p>
								<p>Concentration "level 1" indicates the lowest pollutant concentrations, representing zones with better air quality, while concentration "level 5" includes the highest concentrations, typically exceeding EU health-based recommendations.
									This classification allows for clear visual mapping and facilitates comparisons between areas and pollutants.
									
								</p>
								<p>
									In Kosovo, concentration maps highlight particularly elevated levels of PM₂.₅ and NO₂ in urban areas such as Pristina and Obiliq, largely due to traffic emissions, domestic heating and coal-based energy production.

						<p>The Annual Average Difference map illustrates how air pollution levels in a specific year differ from the average of the previous five years. In this case, it compares the 2022 concentrations of NO₂ and PM₂.₅ in Kosovo with the average levels recorded between 2017 and 2021.
							This method highlights short-term changes and anomalies in air quality, offering insights into potential influences such as policy measures, atypical weather conditions, or exceptional events (wildfires, increased traffic… ).
							
						</p>
						<p>
							Positive values indicate that pollutant concentrations in 2022 were higher than the five-year average, suggesting a possible deterioration in air quality. This may be linked to factors such as elevated emissions, adverse meteorological conditions, or temporary spikes in human activity.
Negative values reflect lower concentrations, pointing to a potential improvement in air quality due to emission reductions, reduced activity levels, or favorable atmospheric dispersion.

						</p>
						<p>
							In Kosovo, the AAD maps reveal a general improvement in PM₂.₅ levels, with several areas showing negative differences. Meanwhile, NO₂ concentrations appear mostly stable, though localized increases are observed, particularly in central and eastern areas.

						<h3>Kosovo - Bivariate Maps</h3>
						<p></p>
					</header>
					<div class="row gtr-200">
						<div class="col-6 col-12-narrower" , style="text-align: justify;">
							<p>The bivariate map combines two spatial variables, pollutant concentration (NO₂ or PM₂.₅) and population count, and assigns a unique color to each combination of classified values using a color grid.
								This approach allows simultaneous visualization of pollution levels and population exposure, helping to reveal where environmental risk intersects with human presence.
								The map offers a nuanced spatial understanding of exposure, where color intensity reflects the combination of both variables, from low-low to high-high risk zones. This method is especially useful for targeted policy interventions, as it helps identify priority areas where mitigation efforts could most effectively reduce public exposure to air pollution.								
							</p>
							<p>
								In the case of Kosovo, the bivariate maps highlight different patterns for NO₂ and PM₂.₅. 
								For NO₂, most areas display moderate exposure levels, although some central zones show a combination of higher population density and moderate pollution, indicating areas of potential concern.
For PM₂.₅, the highest exposure is observed in northern and eastern regions, where elevated pollutant concentrations overlap with denser populations.

							The ESA Climate Change Initiative Land Cover dataset provides global information on land cover based on a classification 
							system developed by the FAO. It includes 22 detailed classes that describe 
							various types of land use and natural cover, such as forests, grasslands, croplands, wetlands, and urban areas.
							For analytical purposes, these detailed classes were grouped into broader categories following a simplified scheme 
							proposed by the IPCC. The main groups considered are: Agriculture, Forest, Grassland, Wetland, Settlement, and Other. 
							This reclassification makes it easier to interpret and compare land cover data across regions and over time.
