						<p>On this page, some basic statistics and information about soil usage in Kosovo will be presented,
							as part of the obtained results. Additional statistics will be included in a future version of 
							the website.
						</p>

						<h3>Usage of the soil</h3>
						<div class="row gtr-200">
							<div class="col-6 col-12-narrower">
								<p>Looking at the chart on the right, it is possible to observe the distribution of soil usage in Kosovo.
								   Although settlements account for approximately 2% of land use, Kosovo remains a highly polluted country.
								   Interestingly, a significant portion of the population — around 58% — still lives in rural areas.</p>
								   <p>
								   So, why is Kosovo so polluted? The main reason is that most of the country’s energy is still produced from coal,
								   due to a lack of funding for modern technologies and limited regulations regarding allowable pollutant emissions.
								   </p>
							</div>
							<div class="col-6 col-12-narrower" style = "margin-bottom: 2em">
								<img src="images/soil_chart.png" alt="Kosovo" style="width: 110%; height: 100%;">
							</div>
						</div>

						<h3>Minimum and maximum value of the pollutants over the years</h3>
						<div style="text-align: justify;">
							<div>
								<p>After discussing the settlement areas in our research, we analyzed the maximum and minimum 
									levels of NO₂ and PM2.5 recorded over the years, specifically within these areas. Below are two 
									graphs showing the changes in pollutant levels over time, with both the maximum and minimum 
									values displayed in the same chart. The graph on the left presents data for particulate matter (PM2.5), 
									while the graph on the right shows values for nitrogen dioxide (NO₂).
								</p>
							</div>
							<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; gap: 20px; width: 100%;">
  								<img src="images/histogram_pm2.5.png" alt="PM2.5" style="width: 45%; height: auto;">
  								<img src="images/histogram_no2.png" alt="NO2" style="width: 45%; height: auto;">
							</div>
							<div style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 2em;">
								<p>From the graphs, it is possible to observe that the annual limit for PM2.5 established by the European Union 
									— set at 25 μg/m³ — was exceeded only in 2016 and 2017, while NO₂ levels remained consistently below the threshold.
									However, these results do not necessarily reflect the real situation. In Kosovo, air quality monitoring stations are
									often not well distributed: some are located in less polluted areas rather than in the most critical zones. In addition,
									gaps in the time series — especially during the most polluted months — make it difficult to obtain accurate yearly estimates.
									What is known, however, is that Kosovo still needs significant improvement in air quality management. During winter,
									PM2.5 levels can often exceed 40 to 60 μg/m³, posing serious health risks.
								</p>
							</div>
							<div style = "margin-top: 2em">
								<h3>Risk for the population</h3>
							<div  style = "text-align: justify;">
								<p>
									Another important aspect in the analysis to determine whether a country's population 
									is at risk due to air pollution is to calculate the percentage of people exposed to different 
									levels of pollutant concentration.The pie charts below illustrate this information: on the left,
									the results for PM2.5 are shown, while on the right, the chart represents the exposure levels for NO₂.
								</p>
							</div>	
							</div>
							<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; gap: 25px; width: 100%;">
								<img src="images/pie_chart_pm2p5.png" alt="PM2.5" style="width: 42%; height: auto;">
  								<img src="images/pie_chart_no2.png" alt="NO2" style="width: 45%; height: auto;">
							</div>
							<div style = "text-align: justify; margin-top: 2em;">
								<p>
									For particulate matter 2.5, the concentration levels to which the majority of the population 
									is exposed are high.To confirm this, we suggest referring to the concentration map table in 
									the Map Description webpage.
								</p>
								<p>
									In contrast, the situation for NO₂ is better, as the concentration levels to which the population
									is exposed correspond to the lowest classes, as shown in the table of its concentration map.
